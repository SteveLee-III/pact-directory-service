# PACT Identity Management

## About this Project

[PACT Network](https://www.carbon-transparency.org/network) establishes an open and global network of interoperable solutions for the secure peer-to-peer exchange of accurate, primary and verified PCF data - across all industries and value chains.

Identity Management is a foundational service of the PACT Network. Identity Management enables organizations to securely and efficiently identify and establish trust connections with each other at scale, facilitating PCF exchange between solutions.

### What is IM?
In its initial form, PACT Identity Management Service will provide organizations with the following capabilities:
- Register to PACT Network
- Find others on the PACT Network
- Manage credentials of customers and their suppliers by providing authentication as a service

The service will provide a robust high integrity registry of organizations on the PACT Network, ready to connect and exchange PCF information.

See the [technical design](https://github.com/wbcsd/pact-directory/blob/main/docs/authentication-as-a-service-design.md) for more details.

### Timeline
- A working group was formed in September 2024 to co-create PACT Identity Management service
- An MVP was developed from October - December 2024
- Alpha MVP Testing phase launched January 2025
- Beta MVP Testing phase launched March 2025
- [PACT Identity Management Vision Paper](https://www.carbon-transparency.org/resources/pact-identity-management-vision-paper) was published March 2025
- V1 of Identity Managment is being planned, pending learnings from MVP testing phase

### How to test MVP
- Any organization globally may participate in testing Identity Management MVP, provided the organization has built or is buiding a PACT Conformant Solution implementing [PACT Tech Specs](https://wbcsd.github.io/data-exchange-protocol/v2/). There is no cost to participate in testing.
- Testing is estimated to take up to 10 hours; organizations are requested to complete testing by April 30, 2025.
- Why test? Gain early access to the service, provide feedback to influence the direction of the service post MVP, be promoted as an early tester of the MVP
- Useful links: [Testing instructions](https://github.com/wbcsd/pact-directory/blob/main/docs/integration-guide.md), [Live MVP](https://pact-directory-portal.onrender.com/)
- Write to Beth (hadley@wbcsd.org) to join MVP testing

### Design Principles 
The PACT community is now working to address these challenges by creating an open-source Identity Management service. This service is being designed using the following principles:
1. Easy & simple to use
2. Secure
3. Standards based
4. Global, low-cost and fair
5. Open and federated
6. Iterative
